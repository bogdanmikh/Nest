# Contributing 

Contributions are welcome. Thank you for making the effort.

If you've got code to contribute, feel free to use the scripts in the `tests` directory to make sure the code doesn't have any warnings and passes analyzer checks. Those same checks are applied when a pull request is created.

## Adding a New Feature

I'd like to keep GLFM small, and some features may not be a good fit. Feel free to create an issue or send me an email to see if your idea would work.

If you are adding a new feature, you do not have to implement it on all three platforms (iOS, Android, Emscripten), but at least two platforms would be nice.
